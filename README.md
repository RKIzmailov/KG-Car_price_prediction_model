# Vehicle Price Prediction for Cars in Kyrgyzstan
This project aims to predict the prices of vehicles for sale in Kyrgyzstan using machine learning techniques. The project involves several steps, including web scraping, data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter optimization, and model ensembling.

## Project Overview

1. **Web Scraping**: Information about vehicles for sale in Kyrgyzstan was obtained by scraping relevant websites. This data includes details such as make, model, year, mileage, and sale price. Car data has been scrapped from a popular car sale ad aggregator mashina.kg
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data was cleaned, processed, and visualized to prepare it for model training. This step involved handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
3. **Model Training**: Several machine learning models, such as linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, were trained on the preprocessed data to predict rental prices.
4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: The performance of the trained models was further improved by optimizing their hyperparameters using Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework.
5. **Model Ensembling**: To achieve even better prediction accuracy, multiple models were combined using a stacking ensemble technique.

## Purpose and Learning Outcomes
This project was undertaken for educational and self-development purposes. Through this project, I gained experience in the following areas:
- Web scraping techniques
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Model ensembling

The vehicle price prediction model developed in this project can be potentially used by companies to provide consultation services to prospective clients in the automotive market.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
